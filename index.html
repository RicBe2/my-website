  <h1> I MET JOE </h1>
  <p class="row_element">
    Joe Hisaishi is the primary composer for Studio Ghibli, having scored nearly all of Hayao Miyazaki's animated films, including Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, and Princess Mononoke. His iconic, symphonic scores have become a defining element of the Studio Ghibli sound and are often performed in live concerts and have been released on numerous soundtracks and compilations.</p>

<p>I was gifted an opportunity to visit Joe Hisaishi at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and since then, I have been absorbed into the fantastical Ghibli world.</p>
